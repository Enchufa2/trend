Planned features
================

	* Multiple trends in a single graph.

	* Binary input

	* Rate-limiting for binary input only:
	specify the frequency of the input values in order to block the
	'feeder' without the need to code sleeping loops. This has timing
	implications, and it's too imprecise for ASCII input.

	* More optimizations can be done for: different shading, different
	inputs, deque.

	* Differential input (initial absolute value and relative ones
	following).
