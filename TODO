Planned features
================

	* Multiple trends in a single graph. I'd appreciate comments on that
	(how the interface should respond, where to place the values, etc).

	* Binary input

	* Rate-limiting for binary input only:
	specify the frequency of the input values in order to block the
	'feeder' without the need to code sleeping loops. This has timing
	implications, and it's too imprecise for ASCII input.

	* Differential input (initial absolute value and relative ones
	following).

	* More optimisations can be done for: different shading, different
	inputs, deque.

	* The synchronised areas should be reduced considerably.

	* "Integration" sidebar, quantization script.
