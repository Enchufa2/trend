Planned features
================

	* Multiple trends in a single graph. I'd appreciate comments on that
	(how the interface should respond, where to place the values, etc:
	I don't feel the idea "intuitive" or very convenient).

	* Binary input

	* Rate-limiting for binary input only (specify the frequency of the
	input values in order to block the 'feeder' without the need to code
	sleeping loops. This has timing implications, and it's too imprecise
	for ASCII input.) or additional tool.

	* Differential input (initial absolute value and relative ones
	following).

	* More optimisations can be done for: different shading, different
	inputs, deque (synchronised areas should be reduced considerably),
	internal latencies.

	* Quantisation script.
